# Changes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the Kasirooms project.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `.gitignore`
**Issue**: Was minimal and didn't exclude build artifacts
**Fix**: Added comprehensive exclusions for:
- `.next/` build directory
- `.env` and `.env*.local` environment files
- `node_modules` dependencies
- TypeScript build info
- Debug logs
- Vercel deployment files
- Other common Next.js artifacts

### 2. `package.json`
**Issues**:
- Package name was "operatore-frontend" instead of "kasirooms"
- Missing lint script

**Fixes**:
- Renamed package to "kasirooms"
- Added `"lint": "next lint"` script
- Added ESLint dependencies in devDependencies

### 3. `.env.example`
**Issue**: Had a typo with closing parenthesis and wrong variable name
**Fix**: 
- Changed from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080)` 
- To `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080`
- Removed trailing parenthesis

### 4. `vercel.json`
**Issue**: Referenced incorrect path `frontend/package.json`
**Fix**: Changed to correct path `package.json` (project is not in a frontend subdirectory)

### 5. `src/app/layout.tsx`
**Issue**: Referenced non-existent CSS files (base.css, layout.css, components.css, theme.css)
**Fix**: 
- Commented out non-existent CSS file references
- Added note that these files need to be created
- Kept only the working `overrides.css`
- This prevents 404 errors for missing CSS files

### 6. `.eslintrc.json` (New File)
**Purpose**: Added ESLint configuration for code quality
**Content**: Configured with `next/core-web-vitals` preset compatible with Next.js 14.2.5

### 7. `README.md`
**Issue**: Was minimal with only "operatore-platform" heading
**Fix**: Created comprehensive documentation including:
- Project description
- Features list
- Getting started instructions
- Prerequisites
- Installation steps
- Development, build, and lint commands
- Project structure overview

### 8. Repository Cleanup
**Action**: Removed build artifacts from git tracking
- Removed `.next/` directory (108+ files)
- Removed `.env` file
- These are now properly excluded via `.gitignore`
